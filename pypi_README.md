pybso - Open Access Monitoring
============================================================

## Installation

     pip install pybso

## Presentation

This package automates the harvesting and graphic formatting of data related to the opening of a set of publications identified by their doi.
The selected indicators and the graphic rendering are strongly inspired by the [national barometer](https://ministeresuprecherche.github.io/bso/) produced by the french Ministry of Higher Education under the Open Science Plan.
The metadata used to assess Open Access rates and trends comes primarily from the open database Unpaywall and the Crossref's registers by their respective API, and the charts are made with the Plotly Library.

The source code of the package is available on [Github](https://github.com/gegedenice/pybso), with a demo Jupyter Notebook.

However, because of the french context of this tool, all the documentation is written in French.
